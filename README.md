# Fast_Bayesian_Regression

by **Aditya Pandya**

This is the python scipt for performing bayesian linear regression.<br />
It takes in the x and y data along with their errors and gives best fit results such as slope, intercept and intrinsic scatter along with their standard deviation values.

It requires use of 2 python packages: numpy and numba <br />
Install numba using "$ pip install numba" in the terminal. <br />
For more documentation visit: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/index.html

Along with the python script, there is a jupyter notebook file which shows how to use the script with an example along with basics of bayesian linear regression.

Here is the flowchart of the algorithm used for bayesian linear regression:
