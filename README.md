# Fast_Bayesian_Regression

by **Aditya Pandya**

This is the Python script for performing fast Bayesian linear regression.<br />
It takes in the x and y data along with their errors and gives best-fit results such as slope, intercept, intrinsic scatter, and their respective standard deviation values.
It contains various functions to perform the task and get plots. 

Script requires the use of 4 Python packages: numpy, numba, seaborn and corner <br />
Install numba using "$ pip install numba" in the terminal. <br />
For more documentation, visit: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/index.html

Along with the Python script, there is a jupyter notebook which contains a tutorial for the basics of Bayesian linear regression using the code from the script

Here is the flowchart of the algorithm used for Bayesian linear regression:
